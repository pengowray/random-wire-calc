# Random Wire Calculator [VK3PGO]

This is the repo for [VK3PGO's Random Wire Calculator](https://pengowray.github.io/random-wire-calc/). The calculator will suggest to you, the amateur radio enthusiast, good lengths of wire to cut your random wire antenna. The methodology used by this calculator to choose wire lengths is needlessly complex, unscientific, undocumented, unverified and untested. I make no claims to the validity of the results. Enjoy the visual plot, and decide for yourself. 

You can see feedback for how well various suggested wire lengths worked under [Discussion > Show and tell](https://github.com/pengowray/random-wire-calc/discussions/categories/show-and-tell). Or at least you'll see your own feedback there after you leave it. You can also find known issues and report bugs under the "Issues" tab.

Read [Jack VE3EED's 2013 post about The Best Random Wire Antenna Lengths](https://www.hamuniverse.com/randomwireantennalengths.html). Jack's recommended wire lengths can be viewed in this Random Wire Calculator by clicking the checkbox with his callsign.

A random wire antenna (or long-wire antenna) is random in the sense of XKCD 221, and is best when its electrical length does not match the wavelength of any frequency you plan to tune your radio to (or multiples/subharmonics of those frequencies). When the random wire was first developed, possibly by Sir John Random, it was believed that by avoiding all resonances of all ham bands, something magical and paradoxical could happen, but only if a counterpoise and a 9:1 unun were employed. You also want a wire length that is more than 1/4 of the longest wavelength you plan to use. Maybe I'll update this when I come to understand it all better. In the meantime, please check out reputable websites to learn about the random wire antenna, or check the discussion tab, where amateur radio folk sit around and wait all day for someone else to comment.
