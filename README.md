# Random Wire Calculator [VK3PGO]

This is the repo for [VK3PGO's Random Wire Calculator](https://pengowray.github.io/random-wire-calc/). The calculator will suggest to you, the amateur radio enthusiast, good lengths of wire to cut your random wire antenna. The methodology used by this calculator to choose wire lengths is needlessly complex, unscientific, undocumented, unverified and untested. I make no claims to the validity of the results. Enjoy the visual plot, and decide for yourself. You can see feedback for how well various suggested wire lengths worked in the Discussion section (Or at least you'll see your own feedback there after you leave it).

Read [Jack VE3EED's 2013 post about The Best Random Wire Antenna Lengths](https://www.hamuniverse.com/randomwireantennalengths.html). Jack's recommended wire lengths can be viewed in this Random Wire Calculator too by pressing the checkbox.

A random wire antenna (or long-wire antenna) is random in the sense of XKCD 221, and is designed to avoid having the same physical length as any wavelength of any frequency you might tune your radio to, and also multiples of those frequencies. When it was first developed, possibly by John Random, it was believed that by avoiding all resonances of all ham bands, something magical and paradoxical could happen, but only if a counterpoise and a 9:1 unun were employed. Maybe I'll update this when I come to understand it all better. In the meantime, please check out reputable websites to learn about the random wire antenna, or check the discussion tab, where people sit and wait all day for someone else to comment.
